<p>Xiaohe Liu Heen</p>

<p>Candidate for the Master of Arts in Arts Administration and Policy at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. I am a China born, Norwegian-based interdisciplinary artist and cultural organizer interested in cities, social justice, and our cultural commons. I have an MA, Design, from Bergen National Academy of the Arts, Norway and a BFA, Art, from Yanshan University, China. I have spent much of my time working with cultural institutions, focusing upon socially engaged and collective public art projects. My primary perspective is that of coalescing arts and cultural organizations with various sociological, political and anthropological discourses in the context of globalization. I focus specifically on how to effect social change and public understanding of cultural diversity. I am interested in understanding how to use interdisciplinary intelligence to design a multi-use public space that fuses municipal, educational, cultural and citizen needs, using technology and social networking as proactive tools to engage local stakeholders interests, while advancing business investment, and increasing the cityâ€™s capabilities towards to a more sustainable future.</p>
