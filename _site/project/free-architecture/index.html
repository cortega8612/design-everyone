<p><p>Free sample architecture is a design methodology that sparks new communication pathways. It uses design interventions as a conversational icebreaker between designers, the authorities who manage public space, and the many people who experience it.</p>

<p>In Free Sample Architecture, designers employ physical prototypes to test out potential solutions to a design challenge, in small low-risk components. Individuals who encounter the humble “free sample” experience it first hand. Documenting visitors’ positive or negative reactions, through voting, provides anecdotal but earnest feedback about the value of particular design possibility.</p>

<p>Human-scale prototypes are accessible to all demographics of people, provided they are occupying the hyperlocal space of the site. In many cities, individuals or marginalized groups may not presently recognize that they have a right to help shape the public spaces around them. By providing a simple democratic voting platform, accessible to anyone in the physical site, the design process fosters agency.</p>

<p>A democratic process of identifying what people need at a site has the potential to break through the limitations of existing forms of observational site research. Public space design can be transformed into a welcoming, transparent series of interactions.</p>

<p>Initial reactions to a prototype begin to contributes to ongoing development of a project. Because designers can often gain access to the authorities who control public spaces, designers must be informed about the desires of a space’s users. If designers are more aware of what the public craves in a space, they can become mediators between those with the power to make the changes and the impacted public.</p>

<p>Cities are becoming more resilient via increasingly inclusive design processes. In my final year of the Master of Architecture program at SAIC, I am emboldened by the vibrancy of the walkable, democratic streetscape. I seek experimental approaches to urban design rooted in deep inquiry and frank exchange. My B.A. in Art History and Criticism from Bates College, with minor in Economics, culminated in an interview-driven undergraduate thesis on new models of urban public housing. Prior to Chicago, I was a writer and curatorial assistant in New York, and later at the Smithsonian’s Hirshhorn Museum. A hungry wanderlust led to art criticism projects in Buenos Aires and Cape Town. Despite a love of experiential travel and urban life, the rugged resourcefulness of rural New England fuels my design sensibility.</p></p>
