<div class="row project"><p class='col-md-8 col-md-offset-2'> Quilting Chicago is a public art project that critically and creatively engages community stakeholders in issues of public space within the city of Chicago.  Working in partnership with Chicago Public Schools, we are creating a large-scale, modular mural which will temporarily cover the facade of the abandoned substation at 10 East Lake Street in the Loop.  The purpose of the mural is three-fold:  first, it will create opportunities for youth artistic expression and reflection; second, it will articulate our citizens needs in an elegant and artistic manner; finally, it will beautify and become a point of interest at an underused but central location. </p><p class='col-md-10 col-md-offset-1'><img alt='Yollocalli' class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' src='/images/2014-04-11-yollocalli-space/quilt.jpg' /></p><p class='col-md-8 col-md-offset-2'> Created by GFRY Studio students Moeko Crider (MAAE), William Estrada (MAAE), and Brendan Hudson (MAAE) in collaboration with Yollocalli Arts Reach Youth Council members Fatima Garcia, Frances Rubi Guillen, Gabriela Ibarra, Joseph Josue Mora, Edward Ruiz, Gilberto Sandoval, and Youth Development Advisor Whitney Ross. </p><h2 class='col-md-10 col-md-offset-2'>Author</h2><div class='col-md-12'>

	<p class='col-md-7 col-md-offset-2'> I am an artist and educator whose work is dedicated to bringing social change through community-based youth media and public art projects. I am currently pursuing a Master of Arts in Art Education at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Prior to this, I worked for almost a decade teaching film, photography, radio production, and visual art in a number of different community settings. I most recently ended a three-year position at Creative Action, running daily after-school art mentorship programs at underserved public schools. I have also served as the Youth Radio Producer at Texas Folklife and the Program Coordinator for Longhouse Media’s Native Lens program, among other positions. The projects I have collaborated on with my students have been screened on television, at international film festivals, NPR and other public radio affiliates, and in galleries and museums throughout the US, including an extended exhibition at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. <a href='/docs/MC_saic.pdf' target='_blank'>Read more about me.</a>

He has worked with community organizations since 1998 and continues to participate in various community projects in the Chicago land area. William’s participation in GFRY Studio stems from his interest and constant discussion with people who are marginalized and deal with racism, displacement, media inequality, cultural preservation, misrepresentation, historical passivity, and other matters affecting our communities. <a href='/docs/WE_saic.pdf' target='_blank'>Read more about me.</a>

	I am a muralist, community arts facilitator, artist, educator and a student in the MAAE program. I am dedicated working with communities to re-imagine and redefine the social and physical spaces we inhabit through the process of creating community arts projects. I facilitate projects in the US and abroad that empower youth to become active change agents in their neighborhoods. Critical pedagogy, self-empowering education, responsive design processes, conversation, and collaboration are central in my practice. I am the recipient of the McArthur ICF grant, 100 Projects for Peace grant and many more awards and commissions. <a href='/docs/BH_saic.pdf' target='_blank'>Read more about me.</a>
