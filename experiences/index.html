	<p> We can consider a society to be democratic when it enables the full participation of its citizens and promotes the goals of opportunity, fairness, and justice. Designers can play a considerable role in maintaining a democratic process by analyzing democratic institutions and procedures as objects of design, creating tools to enhance participation in public debates about the practice of democracy, and designing projects to achieve the end goals that a democracy promises. </p> 
	<p>At a time when the tenets of democracy are under siege, mobilizing designers to help sustain, and invigorate its values is crucial. This event was held on September 27, SAIC Sullivan Galleries, 33 S. State St., 7th floor in our GFRY Studio and at The Art Institute of Chicago, Sullivan Gallery and included a lecture by Lecturer Victor Margolin, Professor Emeritus of Design History at the University of Illinois, Chicago.</p>

	<p> Radical Love, Play, Conscientização, and Expanding Boundaries: A Performance Workshop on Social Change, was a 1 1/2-day event, hosted by GFRY Studio, that focused upon theoretical commonalities of Paulo Freire, Eric Fromm, and Augusto Boal, using Pedagogy, and Theater of the Oppressed texts, and an exploration of freedom and action, grounded with/by/through the body.</p>
	
	<p>The GFRY Studio, together with Alex Starr, and Sebastian Alvarez, organized an evening of presentations, readings, discussions and food, followed by an all day collaborative workshop, exploring social praxis. The workshop sought to explore and link the educational theories of Paulo Freire, and Eric Fromm, with an understanding of the praxis of Augusto Boal. This event was held on January 16 & 18, at The Art Institute of Chicago, Sullivan Gallery.

	<p> This think tank was intended to take stock of how Chicagoans are imagining change. Our increasingly inter-relational, co-dependent world requires new forms of co-evolution. The thinkers, designers, and makers participating in this session speculated on the future of this city as they brought forward ideas ranging from infrastructure and architecture to the natural landscape and social institutions.</p>

	<p>This event was coordinated by GFRY Publi©ity Studio, presenters at this event included local thinkers who framed key issues in ecological and social resilience and capacity building. Our featured guest speakers were, Ken Dunn, Founder and Director, Resource Center, Laura Forlano, Asst.
