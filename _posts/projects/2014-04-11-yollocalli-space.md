<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> Quilting Chicago is a public art project that critically and creatively engages community stakeholders in issues of public space within the city of Chicago.  Working in partnership with Chicago Public Schools, we are creating a large-scale, modular mural which will temporarily cover the facade of the abandoned substation at 10 East Lake Street in the Loop.  The purpose of the mural is three-fold:  first, it will create opportunities for youth artistic expression and reflection; second, it will articulate our citizens needs in an elegant and artistic manner; finally, it will beautify and become a point of interest at an underused but central location. </p>

	I am a muralist, community arts facilitator, artist, educator and a student in the MAAE program. I am dedicated working with communities to re-imagine and redefine the social and physical spaces we inhabit through the process of creating community arts projects. I facilitate projects in the US and abroad that empower youth to become active change agents in their neighborhoods. Critical pedagogy, self-empowering education, responsive design processes, conversation, and collaboration are central in my practice. I am the recipient of the McArthur ICF grant, 100 Projects for Peace grant and many more awards and commissions. <a href='/docs/BH_saic.pdf' target="_blank">Read more about me.</a>
