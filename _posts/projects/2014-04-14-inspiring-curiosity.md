<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> By exploring the potential of embedded digital technologies in public spaces, we are able to design architecture that engages it's users while also challenging the alienation and social barriers typically brought on by modern technology. The goal of this project is to create an environment that engages conversation, collaboration and group play among its occupants through the use of technology, ultimately leaving them with unique and memorable experiences.

<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> Curiosity is the drive that pushes mankind to gain an understanding of the world around us. As children, it is the backbone to our learning structure. By constantly interacting with our environment, we form our understanding of the world in part through the information and attitudes we gain from being curious. With this assumption in mind, we can also assume that curiosity can be considered a vehicle that we use to expand ourselves.</p>

 <p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> As we age, we gain a greater understanding of the universe as well as a set of predictable expectations of how it works. Unfortunately, this can prevent us from being curious. By incorporating “easer eggs” into our design of 10 E. Lake, we will encourage curiosity within our users, overall creating a more personal relationship between the space and its occupants.</p>

As an Industrial Designer, I like to work in a variety of media. By emphasizing a combination of functionality and aesthetics, I attempt to create work in which my fascination with the clarity of content and an uncompromising attitude towards efficient and minimalistic design can be witnessed. I strive for perfection and I take pride in the refinement of my craftsmanship and tactile nature. I condone the production of high quality products and this can be seen in my work. I firmly believe that by employing good design, It is possible to solve our greatest problems. </p>
