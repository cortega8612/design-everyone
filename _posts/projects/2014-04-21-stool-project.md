When public infrastructures fail in marginalized communities, members of the community usually criticize the lack of attention government officials give to their communities. Community members have ideas on how to address the failing infrastructure but don’t always have the means to execute projects that will focus attention and resolve the problems they face.

Through collaborations with artists, community members can create interventions that can facilitate the development of campaigns, which can be executed in the community with its members in order to address specific issues they face. Seats in the Median project aims to address the lack of green space in the North Lawndale Community. By placing cement stools in the median on Cermak Avenue, we hope to generate curiosity from community members on the need for spaces to sit and engage in activities that allow for a community to interact with each other. Through these stools, community members will also be able to activate any space where the stool is present; the stool is an object that can reframe what the space can be used for.

The artist’s responsibility in this project is that of a facilitator, they have listened to the communities needs and addressed it through the creation of an object that addresses larger issues affecting the community. It is the object that is created with the community’s input, that begin to shape a larger conversation on how community members can address failing infrastructures within their community.
