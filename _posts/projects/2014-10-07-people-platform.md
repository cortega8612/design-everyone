People's platform is a surface that activates every time some one-steps on top of it. The main idea is to visualize people’s interaction and displacement over a specific place. My goal is that this device will encourage people/users to interact with each other in a more meaningful way.

I am a photographer concerned with the contemporary portrait of our society. The impulse to record clashes within social structures is what has driven me to translate my visual practice into social action. Back in Mexico, the place where I was born and raised, I worked for a non-governmental organization as a social worker. My arrival to the USA– where I have to learn both a new language and subsequently new cultural modes –contributed to my deeper understanding of those inconsistencies in all societies. As a photographer I am inspired to communicate my critique of such contradictions through the medium of images. As a designer, I am interested in the different possible solutions to those contradictions and how the re-thinking of public space, technology and infrastructure can become the catalyzers of change.
