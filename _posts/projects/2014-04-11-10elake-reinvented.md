10 East Lake Street reinvented begins the conversation about the adaptive reuse of underutilized public space and maintaining community integrity through a sustainable, energy efficient, technologically innovative, and culturally significant project. This project will present a model for public space which will bring together the arts, education, culture, planning, preservation, and sustainability for the public good.

While in the GFRY Studio I focused on documenting, assessing, and proposing an adaptive reuse recommendation for the existing building at 10 East Lake Street. I also used this location as a case study to create a Community Checklist (below), based on the studioâ€™s efforts to reinvent 10 East Lake Street, for community members who are interested in maintaining community integrity and values through existing infrastructure.

As a designer and preservationist, I believe great design stems from a foundation of authenticity, commitment, honesty, and responsibility. I am committed to the built and natural environments in which we live and work and believe I, as a designer, take responsibility for the impact these spaces have on one another. I strive to craft spaces that maintain the authenticity of their original use while maintaining relevance. Structures and landscapes are like multi-generational families in that they have an enduring and shared sense of history, but are flexible and yielding as time progresses. Because of their evolving nature, they must be approached with sensitivity to their preservation.
