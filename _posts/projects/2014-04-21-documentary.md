<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> The GFRY Studio is an innovative class providing 12 of SAIC’s talented artists of all disciplines with an incredible opportunity to showcase their creative vision, environmental consciousness, and community engagement efforts. As a photographer, documentary filmmaker, and audio engineer, my vision is to share the ideas’ and inspirations of the class with the world. With the resources and audience that internet platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo, Tumblr, and other forms of social media provide, our story can be told through the eye of my lens. My ultimate goal is to compellingly broadcast the 10 East Lake project to the wider world, and provide insight as to how to make use of public space in urban communities. </p>



<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> This film will include individual and group interviews of all participants and faculty members. The approach I will use is one of story telling, which will include visiting the artist in their studio’s and classrooms as they give us an intimate view of them engaged in their artist practice. It will also showcase our Think Tank series and guest lectures from the fall 2013 and spring 2014 semesters. </p>
