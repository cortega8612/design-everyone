<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> Light Tunnel project is a small-scale social experiment that is designed to work as a social catalyst in allowing the users to become more open minded towards each other. By participating in the interactive experience with others, the users may adopt new ways of seeing and understanding the city and the people within. </p>

<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> The design of the project is very much analogous to the Plato’s cave. In the story, the prisoners are chain-bound to face the wall. Behind the prisoners is the fire. The prisoners watch the casted shadows of all things that pass in front of the fire behind them and start to designate names to the shadows. The shadows are as close as the prisoners come to understanding the reality and the truth. It is ultimately a distorted and warped version of reality that is interpreted and comprehended with diverse idiosyncrasy in perception.</p>

<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> While Plato’s claim is that the philosophers are the people who break free and stare straight at the truth, one must realize the inherent imperfections in human being. In everyday interaction, misunderstanding and miscommunications arise from individual, cultural, gender, age, or income differences. People must accept this unfortunate truth be more open to open to diversity and social experimentalism that suggests new ways of living –new ways seeing and understanding the world. </p>

<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> In this regard, the Light Tunnel Project functions as a social catalyst in introducing the new opportunities of social interaction by providing the new ground rules in a controlled space. The physical structure of the project consists of a projection screen, multiple layers of shadow filters, user interactive space, and a backlight, all in one enclosed unit. At night, the structure lights up to casts shadows of the people inside onto the projection screen. At the moment, the insiders of the tunnel become the performers for the outsiders and puts on an orchestrated show of light and shadow for the audience outside. During the day, when there is plenty of light outside the tunnel, the space turns into one giant camera-obscura that people can get inside. Instead of projecting the light outward, now the tunnel brings in the cityscape of Chicago inside the tunnel and projects it inside the tunnel, and the image of city now becomes the show. During neither of the two shows at different times of the day, can performers and the audiences see each other’s presence or get any kind of feed back from each other. </p>

<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> By engaging in the shows that project the warped and distorted views of Chicago in the disconnected environment that pulls the audience and the performers apart, the viewers may have an opportunity to think about their relative standings in relations to another and try to be more accepting of the interactions with the imperfect others.</p>
