<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> Weather-adaptive structures at 10 E. Lake communicate weather patterns while gathering rainfall for use on site. During sunny conditions, a canopy loosely flutters in the breeze. When barometric pressure drops, and rain is likely, the canopy forms funnels and peaks to direct water to underground storage cisterns.</p>

<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> Humidity sensors in the soil of plant beds on site trigger pumps to direct water to dry beds. The remaining water circulates through a fountain that demonstrates the quantity of water currently stored in the system. When the systemâ€™s storage nears capacity, the fountain spews a rushing current of water; during dry conditions it dribbles a sprinkle. Just as habitual observation of a stream provides an understanding of local precipitation patterns, the canopy and fountain communicate these patterns in an urban context.</p>

	My work examines the relationship between natural systems and cultural patterns. I seek to foster visceral connections with local conditions to provoke examination of ecological issues and to reframe notions of consumption and waste. Prior to the School of the Art Institute, I worked on several projects that examine attitudes towards uses of waterways, fossil fuels, and trash through the lens of travel and habitation on boats made of salvaged materials. I am currently working to examine how sensor-driven reactive technology can communicate environmental conditions. I am a first year Masters student in Designed Objects.
