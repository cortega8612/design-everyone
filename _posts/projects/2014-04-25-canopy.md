<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> Weather-adaptive structures at 10 E. Lake communicate weather patterns while gathering rainfall for use on site. During sunny conditions, a canopy loosely flutters in the breeze. When barometric pressure drops, and rain is likely, the canopy forms funnels and peaks to direct water to underground storage cisterns.</p>

<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> Humidity sensors in the soil of plant beds on site trigger pumps to direct water to dry beds. The remaining water circulates through a fountain that demonstrates the quantity of water currently stored in the system. When the system’s storage nears capacity, the fountain spews a rushing current of water; during dry conditions it dribbles a sprinkle. Just as habitual observation of a stream provides an understanding of local precipitation patterns, the canopy and fountain communicate these patterns in an urban context.</p>

	Julia is a first year student in the Masters of Design in Designed Objects program. She has a Bachelor’s in Arts with an emphasis on Spanish language literature with a minor in Architecture from Wesleyan University. Julia is interested in design implementation on a range of scales, from the personal to the infrastructural. She is currently working on creating kinetic structural designs that adapt to weather conditions to harness natural resources while making spaces more comfortable for human use.
