A collection of strategies and tactics for:
		<li>The creation and consolidation of multidisciplinary collectives.</li>
		<li>The preparation of these collectives for empathetic exploration of local issues and concerns relevant to their situation.</li>
		<li>The strategies for the expansion of dialogue and civic participation.</li>
		<li>The facilitation of reflective interventions and site explorations.</li>
		<li>The identification of issues central for the construction of longer community engagement.</li>
		<li>Transition to community organizing and transformation.</li> 
	</ul>

<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> Instead of the traditional Design Thinking model in which a group of experts parachutes into a situation to research and identify a design problem to be solved, we propose the preparation of more consolidated teams of participants that includes experts and members of the community, who will become committed in deeper and more meaningful engagements with the situation. These collectives, instead of diving directly into the process of ideation and prototyping of solutions, would be capable of organizing and facilitating civic engagement for more spontaneous interventions emerging from the community itself. </p>

	I am Exhibition Design Director at The Field Museum since 2006, with over 20 years of experience as an Architect, Designer, Educator and Artist, working in Spain, Mexico and the United States. My work, ranging from buildings to exhibitions, incorporates arts-based research and design as inquiry in the threshold between pedagogy, philosophy, architecture and poetry. With an interest in experimental gatherings to re-envision the space of shared knowledge and the emergence of creative collaboration, I am pursuing a Master of Arts. At the Gfry Studio I want to critically explore the boundaries of democratic participation in the definition of the public space.
