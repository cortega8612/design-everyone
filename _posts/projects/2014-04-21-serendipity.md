Creating serendipitious moments in the city with harmoniousely curated programs. The boundaries of each project, as well as the 10 E. Lake to be softened by the installation of indigenious plants and serendipitious vegetation.

The question was "Why us?". There are already several projects for urban solutions, hence we had to think of how to make this project unique and authentic at the same time. I figured only way to do that was to create a system that allow everything works harmoniously, and I believe only then a project starts to show its positive quality and engages people.
The research was based on this new field of study, Neuro-architecture, and healing urban space.
Apparently, the living organisms on site is a great medium because of its controlled but not limited way of growth.
