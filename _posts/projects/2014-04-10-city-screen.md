<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> City Screen including light installations combined with Arduino based environmental sensors that create a sensory experience and attract attention from people passing by and make them curious about the 10 East Lake Street. The projections on the facade of the site function as a platform for providing open resources and educational programs sustainability and green technology.</p>

<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> The projection contains a series of programs including neighborhood based storytelling meant to promote a sense of participation, a virtual garden which should have a restorative effect on cognitive functioning of interactions with natural versus urban environments; and data visualization that reflect the environment condition surround the site. The sensors transmit live data over wireless link for visualization in a projection.  The visualization reacts to movement, light, and sound, also tracing CO, gas level, temperature and humidity. The motion sensor traces movements of people passing by and the LED lights installed on the wall of 10 East Lake Street will blink responsively. Through the visualize data, the advanced technical data for green technology will be interpreted in a playful and easy to read information for the public to receive and interact.</p>

<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> The GFRY interactive website fosters connection with the public and value theirs voices. The website uses social media and hash tag to make dialogues with the public and provide open data and resources of sustainability and green technology. The public can also use mobile devices to interact with the web server and will be reflected the site projection. The billboards installed on the train track near the site function as portable platforms for display information for different program and function as acoustic barriers to reduce the noise from the red line train passing by. The sensory installations can be furthered develop for a lower budget and user-friendly version that could be easily distribute in a boarder public. The distributed sensors can be used as a tool for connect the public and form a grass-root movement that invite the public works together for open data and resources of sustainability and green technology.</p>
