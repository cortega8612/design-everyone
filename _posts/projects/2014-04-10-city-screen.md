<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> The City Screen project includes light installations combined with Arduino based environmental sensors that create a sensory experience and attract the curiosity of people passing by the 10 East Lake Street site. The visualization reacts to movement, light, and sound, while also tracking CO and other gas levels, temperature, and humidity. Through the visualization of environmental data, the advanced technical data for green technology will be interpreted in a playful and easy to read format for the public to receive and interact. </p>

<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> Art in urban spaces changes perception, initiates new forms of communication, and provides information and dialog for social change. Digital and mobile media are changing the way our lives take shape and how we experience our built environment. City Screen unites public art and digital media through a series of projections, screenings, and interactive new media installations that invite the public to redesign 10 East Lake Street while also providing information on sustainability and green technology resources. City Screen uses technology to visualize data, increase environmental awareness, and influences the way that our city functions as a community. City Screen is where the stories, desires and memories of people are projected.</p>

<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> The City Screen project includes light installations combined with Arduino based environmental sensors that create a sensory experience and attract the curiosity of people passing by the 10 East Lake Street site. The projections on the facade of the site function as a platform for providing open resources and educational programs around sustainability and green technology, neighborhood based storytelling meant to promote a sense of participation, a virtual garden which should have a restorative effect on cognitive functioning of interactions with natural versus urban environments; and data visualization that reflect the environmental conditions surrounding the site. The sensors transmit live data over wireless link for visualization in a projection.  The visualization reacts to movement, light, and sound, while also tracking CO and other gas levels, temperature, and humidity. The motion sensor traces movements of people passing by and the LED lights installed on the wall of 10 East Lake Street will blink responsively. Through the visualization of environmental data, the advanced technical data for green technology will be interpreted in a playful and easy to read format for the public to receive and interact. </p>
