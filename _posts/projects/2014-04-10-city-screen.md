City Screen is a series of projections, screenings and interactive new media installations inviting the public to redesign 10 East Lake Street and provide the public access to sustainability and green technology resources. City Screen as the urban media uses technology to visualize data and increase our awareness of environment, as well as influences the way that our city functions as a community. City Screen invites public participant to work together toward sustainability. City Screen is where the stories, desires and memories of people are projected.

Xiaohe Liu Heen

Candidate for the Master of Arts in Arts Administration and Policy at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. I am a China born, Norwegian-based interdisciplinary artist and cultural organizer interested in cities, social justice, and our cultural commons. I have an MA, Design, from Bergen National Academy of the Arts, Norway and a BFA, Art, from Yanshan University, China. I have spent much of my time working with cultural institutions, focusing upon socially engaged and collective public art projects. My primary perspective is that of coalescing arts and cultural organizations with various sociological, political and anthropological discourses in the context of globalization. I focus specifically on how to effect social change and public understanding of cultural diversity. I am interested in understanding how to use interdisciplinary intelligence to design a multi-use public space that fuses municipal, educational, cultural and citizen needs, using technology and social networking as proactive tools to engage local stakeholders interests, while advancing business investment, and increasing the cityâ€™s capabilities towards to a more sustainable future.
