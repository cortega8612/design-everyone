The main idea behind my project is to find, or “define” what is the community around the loop that is interested in rethinking public space. Who is truly invested in making a meaningful impact in the way people interact in the loop outside of privet investors and students. In a sense, it is an intervention to make people reflect upon the idea of how public space defines community and vice versa. 

On of the key components of my project is the use of piezoelectric sensors that respond to changes in pressure. I am particularly interested in this kind of technology because the principal of piezoelectricity indicates that such an electric charge is very common in organic materials such as proteins, bone structures and even DNA. This singular characteristic suggests a connection between the individuals that use the platform and the technology that is underneath. No other type of sensor or electronic device capable of tracking human interaction has such a biological connection with the user. Besides that, the mechanical motion applied to the surface implies direct physical contact between the user and the technology.

I am a photographer concerned with the contemporary portrait of our society. The impulse to record clashes within social structures is what has driven me to translate my visual practice into social action. Back in Mexico, the place where I was born and raised, I worked for a non-governmental organization as a social worker. My arrival to the USA– where I have to learn both a new language and subsequently new cultural modes –contributed to my deeper understanding of those inconsistencies in all societies. As a photographer I am inspired to communicate my critique of such contradictions through the medium of images. As a designer, I am interested in the different possible solutions to those contradictions and how the re-thinking of public space, technology and infrastructure can become the catalyzers of change.
